GMusicEdge
------------------------
Author: @vhanla - Victor Alberto Gil 


Description:
-----------
GMusicEdge is another Google Play Music client but only for Windows 10.

It is based on Edge's WebView (edgehtml.dll) and it means, it doesn't require to use Chromium (big bunch of dll files) nor Electron in order to wrap Google Play Music.

As previous work was written using DCEF3 (Delphi Chromium Embedded Framework) this on the contrary doesn't require it, resulting in a very small executable, now written in C#.
